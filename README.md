# hello-world
The first repository
A lost girl, with a big soul, searching for new opportunities and challenges. 
Stuborn, headstrong, fearless, brave, and hardworking. I am here to make the difference, be the difference. 
Changing carrier, from biomedical scientist to a programmer. 
Technology, photography, arts, music, theater, sing, games, dance, animals and nature are one of my passions. 
Give me a problem that I will find a way to bring you a solution. 
Do not ask me to give up, if I believe, there is nothing that can stop me from trying, except my husband! 
LetÂ´s do it!
