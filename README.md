<h1>The first repository</h1>
<p>A lost girl, with a big soul, searching for new opportunities and challenges. </p>
<p>Stuborn, headstrong, fearless, brave, and hardworking. I am here to make the difference, be the difference. 
Changing carrier, from biomedical scientist to a programmer. 
Technology, photography, arts, music, theater, sing, games, dance, animals and nature are one of my passions. </p>

Do not ask me to give up, if I believe, there is nothing that can stop me from trying, except my husband! </p>
